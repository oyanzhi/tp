## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component" width="800"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Reminders Feature

#### Challenge
* Reminders was the first feature that we deemed as important for MVP - as we decided that reminders will be stored as an `ArrayList<Reminder>` for each `Person`, we needed to expand the current model, logic and storage to include it.

#### Implementation Details

Reminders are set up as a `Reminder.java` class with two key internal fields.
* `String` header
* `LocalDateTime` deadline

<br>

The `add`, `delete` and `edit` reminders commands are then designed as separate commands based on a new field in the `Person.java` class where reminders are internally stored as an `ArrayList<Reminder>` for every `Person` object initialised.

<br>

##### Command Implementation
* ###### Add Reminder
  * The user will execute `reminder CLIENT_INDEX h/HEADER d/yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` which initialises a new `Reminder.java` with the given header and deadline after parsing of the user input is done by `AddReminderCommandParser.java` and validation of header and deadline by `Reminder.java`.
  
  <br>
  
  * A newly initialised `AddReminderCommand.java` will then have the fields before `AddReminderCommand#exceute` is called.
    * `CLIENT_INDEX` 
    * and the previously initialised `Reminder.java`

  <br>
  
  * Upon execution of the `AddReminderCommand`, the method `Person#addReminder` is called on the `Person` with the given `CLIENT_INDEX` in the model which takes in the new `Reminder.java` as parameter and initialises a new `ArrayList<Reminder>` with the `Reminder.java` added to the previous `ArrayList<Reminder>` of the `Person` and returns a new `Person` object with the newly updated `ArrayList<Reminder>`

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ###### Delete Reminder
  * The user will execute `rDelete CLIENT_INDEX REMINDER_INDEX` which are based on the indexes on the displayed GUI after parsing of the user input is done by `DeleteReminderCommandParser.java`.
  
  <br>
  
  * This initialises a new `DeleteReminderCommand.java` with two fields before `DeleteReminderCommand#exceute` is called.
    * `CLIENT_INDEX`
    * `REMINDER_INDEX`

  <br>

  * Upon execution of the `DeleteReminderCommand`, the method `Person#removeReminder` is called on the `Person` with the given `CLIENT_INDEX` in the model which takes in the `Reminder.java` as parameter and initialises a new `ArrayList<Reminder>` with the `Reminder.java` removed from the previous `ArrayList<Reminder>` of the `Person` and returns a new `Person` object with the newly updated `ArrayList<Reminder>`

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ###### Edit Reminder
  * The user will execute `rEdit CLIENT_INDEX REMINDER_INDEX h/HEADER d/yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm` which initialises a new `Reminder.java` with the given header and deadline after parsing of the user input is done by `EditReminderCommandParser.java` and validation of header and deadline by `Reminder.java`.

  <br>

  * This initialises a new `EditReminderCommand.java` with three fields before `EditReminderCommand#execute` is called.
    * `CLIENT_INDEX`
    * `REMINDER_INDEX` which is the index of the reminder to be edited.
    * `EDITED_REMINDER` which is the new `Reminder.java` as parsed and initialised before.
    
  <br>

  * Upon execution of the `EditReminderCommand`
    1. The method `Person#removeReminder` is called on the `Person` with the given `CLIENT_INDEX` in the model which utilises `REMINDER_INDEX` to locate the `Reminder.java` in the `Person` and removes the reminder similar to how `DeleteReminderCommand` is implemented. 
    
    <br>
    
    2. The method `Person#addReminder` is then called on the `Person` with the given `ClIENT_INDEX` in the model which takes in `EDITED_REMINDER` as parameter and adds it to the `Person` similar to how `AddReminderCommand` is implemented.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Meeting Notes Feature

#### Challenges
* Next, we wanted a convenient way for users to record and review key discussions with clients in a simple yet efficient way. We needed to decide what order to store and display meeting notes — whether to prioritise a simple internal logic or a more intuitive user interface.

#### Implementation Details

Meeting Notes are set up as a `MeetingNote.java` class with two key internal fields.
* `String` TEXT
* `LocalDateTime` date and time at which the meeting note was created.

<br>

The `add` and `delete` meeting note commands are then designed as separate commands based on a new field in the `Person.java` class where meeting notes are internally stored as an `ArrayList<MeetingNote>` for every `Person` object initialised.

<br>

##### Command Implementation
* ###### Add Meeting Note
    * The user will execute `note CLIENT_INDEX TEXT` which initialises a new `MeetingNote.java` with the given text and the current LocalDateTime after parsing of the user input is done by `AddMeetingNoteCommandParser.java` and validation of the text by `MeetingNote.java`.

  <br>

    * A newly initialised `AddMeetingNoteCommand.java` will then have the fields before `AddMeetingNoteCommand#exceute` is called.
        * `CLIENT_INDEX`
        * and the previously initialised `MeetingNote.java`

  <br>

    * Upon execution of the `AddMeetingNoteCommand`, the method `Person#addMeetingNote` is called on the `Person` with the given `CLIENT_INDEX` in the model which takes in the new `MeetingNote.java` as parameter and initialises a new `ArrayList<MeetingNote>` with the `MeetingNote.java` added to the previous `ArrayList<MeetingNote>` of the `Person` and returns a new `Person` object with the newly updated `ArrayList<MeetingNote>`.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* ###### Delete Meeting Note
    * The user will execute `nDelete CLIENT_INDEX MEETING_NOTE_INDEX` which are based on the indexes on the displayed GUI after parsing of the user input is done by `DeleteMeetingNoteCommandParser.java`.

  <br>

    * This initialises a new `DeleteMeetingNoteCommand.java` with two fields before `DeleteMeetingNoteCommand#exceute` is called.
        * `CLIENT_INDEX`
        * `MEETING_NOTE_INDEX`

  <br>

    * Upon execution of the `DeleteMeetingNoteCommand`, the method `Person#removeMeetingNote` is called on the `Person` with the given `CLIENT_INDEX` in the model which takes in the `MeetingNote.java` as parameter and initialises a new `ArrayList<MeetingNote>` with the `MeetingNote.java` removed from the previous `ArrayList<MeetingNote>` of the `Person` and returns a new `Person` object with the newly updated `ArrayList<MeetingNote>`.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Star Client Feature

#### Challenges
* The goal was to provide an easy way for users to "star" clients. This would allow users to mark clients they want to highlight or prioritize, and later allow them to remove the starred status if needed. 
* There was some debate on whether to display starred clients in a separate list or to prioritize them within the existing list. We decided to integrate starred clients into the main list, sorting them to appear at the top, which required adding a sorting logic in `Person.java` too.

#### Implementation Details

To implement the star client feature, we focus on the following areas:
1. **Model**: Each `Person` object has a boolean field `isStarred` to mark whether a client is starred or not. The logic of starring or unstarring a client updates this field.

&nbsp;

2. **Commands**: Two main commands are created:
    - `StarCommand`: For marking a client as starred. 
    - `UnstarCommand`: For removing the starred status of a client.

&nbsp;

3. **Parser**: Command parsing logic to ensure that the user's input is valid and parsed correctly into command objects.

&nbsp;

4. **Sorting**: We need to ensure that when clients are starred or unstarred, the list is updated accordingly (both in terms of the internal storage and the displayed user interface).
<br>

##### Command Implementation
* ###### Star Command
    * **Objective**: Marks a `Person` (Client) as starred based on their displayed index in the list.

    &nbsp;

    * **Command Syntax**: `star CLIENT_INDEX`
        * Parameters:
            * `CLIENT_INDEX`: The index of the client (starts from 1 in the displayed list).
        * Usage Example:
            *  `star 1`: Stars the client at index 1.

    &nbsp;

    * **Key Steps**:
        1. *Input parsing:*
            * The `StarCommandParser.java` parses the input string. If the input is empty, a `ParseException` is thrown.
            * The `ParserUtil#parseIndex(String args)` method is used to parse the client index, which is logged for debugging.

        &nbsp;

        2. *Check if Already Starred:*
            * The command retrieves the `Person` object using the parsed index.
            * The `Person#isStarred()` method checks if the client is already starred.
            * If the client is already starred, a `CommandException` is thrown with the message "Chosen client is already starred."

        &nbsp;

        3. *Update Starred Status:*
            * If the client is unstarred, The command updates the client's starred status by calling the `Person#rebuildWithStarredStatus(boolean isStarred)` method. This method creates a new Person object with the updated starred status (set to `true`).
            * The updated `Person` is saved back into the model using `Model#setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)`.

        &nbsp;

        4. *Re-sort the Client List:*
            * After starring a client, the list of clients is re-sorted by calling `Model#sortPersons(Comparator<Person> comparator)`. This ensures that all starred clients are prioritized and appear at the top of the list.

        &nbsp;

        5. *Return Command Result:*
            * The command returns a `CommandResult` with a success message, confirming that the client has been starred.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* ###### Unstar Command
    * **Objective**: Removes the starred status of a `Person` (Client), based on their displayed index in the list.

  &nbsp;

    * **Command Syntax**: `unstar CLIENT_INDEX`
        * Parameters:
            * `CLIENT_INDEX`: The index of the client (starts from 1 in the displayed list).
        * Usage Example:
            *  `unstar 1`: Stars the client at index 1.

  &nbsp;

    * **Key Steps**:
        1. *Input parsing:*
            * The `UnstarCommandParser.java` parses the input string. If the input is empty, a `ParseException` is thrown.
            * The `ParserUtil#parseIndex(String args)` method is used to parse the client index, which is logged for debugging.

      &nbsp;

        2. *Check if Already Unstarred:*
            * The command retrieves the `Person` object using the parsed index.
            * The `Person#isStarred()` method checks if the client is already unstarred.
            * If the client is already unstarred, a `CommandException` is thrown with the message "Chosen client is not starred."

      &nbsp;

        3. *Update Starred Status:*
            * If the client is starred, The command updates the client's starred status by calling the `Person#rebuildWithStarredStatus(boolean isStarred)` method. This method creates a new Person object with the updated starred status (set to `false`).
            * The updated `Person` is saved back into the model using `Model#setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)`.

      &nbsp;

        4. *Re-sort the Client List:*
            * After unstarring a client, the list of clients is re-sorted by calling `Model#sortPersons(Comparator<Person> comparator)`. This ensures that the unstarred client is moved to its appropriate position in the list.

      &nbsp;

        5. *Return Command Result:*
            * The command returns a `CommandResult` with a success message, confirming that the starred status has been removed from the client.
<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## Appendix: Effort

**Scope vs AB3**
- AB3 manages one entity type; FinHub extends the model with **per-client Reminders** and **Meeting Notes**, adds **archiving/star** flows, and an **InsurancePolicy** field. This required new parsers, commands, JSON adapters, UI panels, and tests.

**Difficulty**

1. **Per-client list management (two indexes)**
    - **Why hard:** Commands like `rEdit PERSON_INDEX r/REMINDER_INDEX` touch **two lists**: the filtered people list and a person’s reminder list. Either can be re-indexed after filtering or edits.
    - **What we did:**
        - Resolve indices **late** (inside `Command#execute`) using the **current** filtered lists.
        - Distinguish errors: “invalid **person** index” vs “invalid **reminder** index”.
        - Tests cover off-by-one, empty lists, and filtered views.

2. **Filtered views for Active vs Archived (no duplicated state)**
    - **Why hard:** We want `activelist` / `archivelist` without cloning data or drifting out of sync.
    - **What we did:**
        - Single source of truth (`AddressBook`) with a `isArchived` flag.
        - Switch filters with `updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`; reapply sorts (e.g., starred first) after mutations.

3. **JSON adapters for nested lists & backward compatibility**
    - **Why hard:** We must serialise/deserialise nested `reminders[]` and `notes[]`, and **not break older JSON files** that don’t have these fields.
    - **What we did:**
        - `JsonAdaptedReminder` / `JsonAdaptedMeetingNote` with **tolerant readers** (missing arrays → `[]`; unknown fields → ignored).
        - Fail clearly on corrupted sub-entries; don’t crash the whole file.
        - Migration tests: “old to new” round-trip.

4. **Multiple GUI panels (scrolling/height bugs)**
    - **Why hard:** We now render **three vertical areas**: Client list, Reminder list, Meeting note list. With wrapped text and dynamic content, JavaFX showed:
        - Double/vanishing scrollbars
        - Clipped multi-line text
        - Lists refusing to grow beyond ~3 lines
        - Scroll focus jumping when lists update
    - **What we did (practical fixes):**
        - Avoid `ScrollPane` **inside** `ListView` where possible (one scroll owner).
        - For wrapped labels: `label.setWrapText(true)` and `label.setMinHeight(Region.USE_PREF_SIZE)`.
        - Let cell heights grow: `listView.setFixedCellSize(Region.USE_COMPUTED_SIZE)`.
        - Manage growth in the parent layout: use `VBox.setVgrow(child, Priority.ALWAYS)` only on the container you want to grow; remove conflicting FXML `prefHeight`/`vgrow`.
        - Reapply comparator/filter after mutations to prevent layout thrashing.

**Challenge**

1. **Unclear error messages**
    - **Problem:** “Invalid index” was ambiguous—was it the person or the reminder index?
    - **Fix:** Separate messages (“Invalid **person** index”; “Invalid **reminder** index”) and add tests that assert exact wording.

2. **Filter + command order causing index drift**
    - **Problem:** After `archivelist`, running `star` could reference the old (unfiltered) indices.
    - **Fix:** Resolve indices **after** predicates are applied; standardise a **post-mutation refresh** (reapply predicate + optional sort).

3. **Older JSON files breaking on new fields**
    - **Problem:** Early saves lacked `reminders`/`notes`, causing deserialisation errors.
    - **Fix:** Default missing arrays to `[]`, ignore unknown fields, and report only the corrupted entry (don’t crash everything).

4. **Scrolling regressions after long result messages**
    - **Problem:** `ResultDisplay` grew horizontally and triggered unwanted scrollbars.
    - **Fix:** Wrap long text, avoid nested scrolling, let widths/height be `USE_COMPUTED_SIZE`, and cap max widths where necessary.


**Reused work**
- AB3 infrastructure (UI shell, storage scaffold, test harness, model entities and logic flow).  
  _Net effect_: reduced boilerplate; effort focused on domain/features.

**Effort Required**

**Design & Architecture (≈ 1–2 person-days)
- Identified where **new responsibilities** live (model vs parser vs UI), keeping AB3 layering intact.
- Defined **error messaging strategy** (model-centric constraints; consistent messages).
- Decided on **single-source-of-truth** for people + **view predicates** for Active/Archived/Starred.
- Chose **tolerant JSON readers** (forward/backward compatibility) + strict writers.

**Model & Validation (≈ 1–3 person-days)
- Implemented value objects/entities:
    - `Reminder` (header + future-only datetime, canonical formatter).
    - `MeetingNote` (immutable text).
    - `InsurancePolicy` (trim + regex; explicit constraints).
- Added invariants + unit tests (null/empty, whitespace, format, “close to now” edges).
- Ensured **immutability** or safe copying for nested lists.

**Logic & Parsing (≈ 2–4 person-days)
- New commands & parsers: `addrem`, `editrem`, `delrem`, `addnote`, `delnote`, `archive`, `unarchive`, `activelist`, `archivelist`, `star`, `unstar`.
- **Late index resolution** in `Command#execute` to avoid stale indices under filters.
- Distinct error surfaces for **person index** vs **inner list index**.
- Tests for parsing ambiguity, missing prefixes, and filtered-list behaviors.

**UI Engineering (multi-panel, scrolling) (≈ 3–5 person-days)
- Panels: `ReminderListPanel`, `GeneralReminderListPanel`, `MeetingNoteListPanel`; cards for both.
- Fixed **nested scroll bugs** (double scrollbars, clipped text, scroll focus jumps):
    - Avoid `ScrollPane` inside `ListView`.
    - `setWrapText(true)` + `setMinHeight(Region.USE_PREF_SIZE)` on labels; `setFixedCellSize(Region.USE_COMPUTED_SIZE)` on lists.
    - Single **growth owner** in layouts (no conflicting `vgrow`/`prefHeight`).
- Reapplied comparator/filter **once** after mutations to reduce layout thrashing.
- Visual markers for **starred/archived** without breaking virtualization.

**Storage & Migration (≈ 2–3 person-days)
- Adapters: `JsonAdaptedReminder`, `JsonAdaptedMeetingNote`, updated `JsonAdaptedPerson`.
- **Backward compatibility**: default missing arrays to `[]`, ignore unknown fields; fail only on truly corrupted sub-entries.
- Round-trip tests: new → JSON → new; **old JSON → new model**; mixed lists with corrupted entries.

**Testing (≈ 3–5 person-days)
- **Model**: value object constraints, equals/hashCode, string forms.
- **Logic**: success/failure paths, filtered/archived/starred interactions, two-index commands.
- **Storage**: deserialisation with missing/extra fields, corrupted sub-entries, non-ASCII.
- **UI** (selective): render of multi-line reminder/note cards; no horizontal overflow; no crash on long texts.
- Regression tests for **scrolling bugs** (where feasible) and **message wording**.

**Tooling, CI, Docs (≈ 1–2 person-days)
- Gradle tasks wired for tests and checks; CI green on model/logic/storage suites.
- Updated DG & UG, manual testing appendix, and acknowledgements; PlantUML stubs added.


**Achievements**

**Reliability & Data Safety
- **Future-only reminders** with canonical parsing prevent silent “past reminder” entries.
- **Tolerant JSON readers** mean older saves still load; corrupted sub-items no longer crash the app—users keep the rest of their data.
- **Late index resolution** eliminates a class of “deleted wrong row” bugs in filtered views.

**Usability & UX
- **Clear, targeted errors** (format + future-time; person vs reminder index) reduce user confusion.
- **Multi-panel UI** now handles long, wrapped content without clipping or random scrollbars.
- **Star/Archive indicators** are visible and consistent with list filters.

**Code Quality & Maintainability
- Constraints enforced at the **model boundary** (single source of truth).
- **No duplicated lists** for filters—predicates maintain a coherent view over one dataset.
- Cohesive adapters (`JsonAdapted*`) isolate serialization concerns, easing future schema changes.

**Performance & Responsiveness
- **Virtualized lists** remain snappy even with many reminders/notes.
- Post-mutation **one-shot refresh** prevents relayout storms.

**Developer Experience
- **Deterministic tests**: reduced flakiness from “close to now” cases.
- DG/UG now **point to the right classes and flows**, making onboarding easier.

**Why this effort was necessary**

- Agents can **trust** reminders (they won’t silently schedule in the past) and **keep** their old data through releases.
- The UI supports **realistic, verbose notes** without breaking layout—a must for actual client work.
- The codebase stays **evolvable**: one dataset, clear boundaries, adapters ready for schema growth.
